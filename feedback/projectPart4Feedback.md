## Project Part 4 Feedback

### Final Grade

7/8

### Feedback From Project Part 3

Feedback was addresed.

### Code Base

All requirements completed and code base is well organized. Data validation is present.

### Documentation

Most documentation is quite good but some classes are missing comments about what they do.

### Test Cases

Testing was greatly improved from the first milestone. There could still be some more unit testis for the model classes, and it would be helpful to indicate which tests cover which user stories.

### Object Oriented Design

Make sure both ends of relationships have cardinalities. The diagram is a bit messry and could be organized better. UserProfile should have some connection with login/signup. Seems to represent the current state of the code.

### Backlog

Backlog is up to date.

### UI and Storyboard

UI was mostly updated but panel to seee comments is missing.

### Sprint Planning and Review

Comprehensive sprint plan and meeting notes are present.

### Demo 

Presentation was a bit timid, but there was some energy. There was some eye contact with the audience, but not much. The presentation was on time.

### Tool Use

Some PRs still need better descriptions but this is an improvement.

### Relative Quality

The app could be improved in a variety of ways. While fully functional, the UI could use a major overhaul to make it more asthetically pleasing. Also, error to the user shuold be given with errors on text inputs, not toast messages.
