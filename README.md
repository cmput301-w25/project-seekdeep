## Project Description
This project is an abomination of android studio code, calling for an unreasonable amount of late nights to deliver a completely seamless user experience centered around delivering moods. We aim to decrease META, SNAP, and XHS stock by atleast 10% by next quarter. Given new functionality, and a closer-to-home focus of emotion, We deliver on counts of interface, geolocation, and simplicity.
## Key Features

- **Moods**: Moods are the defining feature of our app. This is the core tenet which users share between each other, aiming to normalize sharing emotions between people.
- **Calendar**: Our app features a calendar which shows a mood impact of each mood per day, for the month.
- **User Search**: Users can search for friends, influencers, and other people using our intuitive search functions
- **Networking**: Using follow requests, locationality, and profiles, users of our app can form strong networks with other users.
- **Map**: Our app has a map which shows users other moods that have happened around them.
- **Profile**: Each user profile functions as the gateway into our experience and features a unqiue and expressive username and login credentials.
