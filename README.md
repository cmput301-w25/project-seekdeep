## Project Description
This project is an abomination of android studio code, calling for an unreasonable amount of late nights to deliver a completely seamless user experience centered around delivering moods. We aim to decrease META, SNAP, and XHS stock by atleast 10% by next quarter. Given new functionality, and a closer-to-home focus of emotion, We deliver on counts of interface, geolocation, and simplicity.
## Key Features
