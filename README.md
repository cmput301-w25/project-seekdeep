## Project Description
This project is an abomination of android studio code, calling for an unreasonable amount of late nights to deliver a completely seamless user experience centered around delivering moods. We aim to decrease META, SNAP, and XHS stock by atleast 10% by next quarter. Given new functionality, and a closer-to-home focus of emotion, We deliver on counts of interface, geolocation, and simplicity.
## Key Features

- [Moods]: Moods are the defining feature of our app. This is the core tenet which users share between each other, aiming to normalize sharing emotions between people.
- [Feature 2]: Brief description
